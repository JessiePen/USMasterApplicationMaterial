> Official transcripts are required and must be received before an application is reviewed. A hard copy transcript is considered official when it is in a sealed, unopened envelope sent directly from your previous institution. To complete your application, submit official transcripts and proof of your undergraduate degree (if completed) from all previously attended post-secondary institutions, even if you were not a matriculated student and/or did not complete an academic program. Failure to submit all academic records will delay the processing of your application, and failure to report all schools attended may result in admission rescission or withdrawal from consideration.
